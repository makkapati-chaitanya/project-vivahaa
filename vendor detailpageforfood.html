                <strong>Reviews:</strong> I had the best experience with ELITE Caterers. They lived up to their reputation & my expectations. I booked them for my wedding, being an Overseas Citizen I had few connections in Hyderabad and was not sure where to go for an excellent service, food, and taste at reasonable prices.
                Elite Caterers took that burden off my plate as I had a lot of preparations to do. The guests loved the taste, and the presentation of the food was more than presentable & satisfactory. I’d like to take this moment to give 5 stars for being very friendly & for giving an excellent service. Thanks.

                We had a good experience with ELITE Caterers for my cousin’s wedding. They offered the best food you can imagine! They took a lot of time & care to ask us questions about what kind of event we were looking for, and what our tastes were like.
                The menu selections were perfectly on-theme. They did an amazing job, the service was also wonderful – the staff they hired for the event was professional yet friendly. overall, the quality of food & level of service is great. 
                We are satisfied.
